# Audit & AI Risk Governance Projects

This repository contains small but impactful hands-on projects in the intersection of Risk, Audit, SOX Compliance, and AI Governance.

## Projects

1. **AI Model Governance Controls Mapping**  
   - COSO risk mapping for ML models  
   - Identify control points across AI lifecycle

2. **Audit Checklist for LLM (ChatGPT) Use in Business**  
   - Risk scenarios  
   - Control suggestions  
   - Governance checklist

3. **Simulated Anomaly Detection (Python)**  
   - Sample transaction data  
   - Python logic to flag outliers  
   - Mock audit memo

## About Me

I’m a CA and CISA-certified audit professional with 9+ years of experience in SOX, Internal Audit, ITGC/ITAC and currently expanding into AI risk governance and data assurance.
# AI-Driven SOX Audit Sample Project

This project demonstrates how AI/ML models can be incorporated into SOX 404 audits, specifically focusing on control documentation and testing of AI systems used in business-critical processes.

## 🧾 Project Components

1. **AI_SOX_Control_Memo.md**  
   A sample SOX 404 control description and design assessment memo covering:
   - AI system functionality & business purpose
   - Model governance & validation checkpoints
   - Risk/control mapping (aligned to COSO & PCAOB guidance)

2. **Model_Review_Tracker.xlsx**  
   A dummy tracker used by internal audit to:
   - Review model performance metrics
   - Track approvals, validations, and change controls
   - Simulate control testing steps

## 🧠 Key Learning Areas
- SOX Control Design for AI/ML systems
- Governance documentation of AI use cases
- Internal audit testing techniques for black-box models

## 📌 Why This Matters
As AI becomes embedded in finance and operations, auditors need to understand how to:
- Identify AI-related control risks
- Validate data inputs and algorithm logic
- Assess governance, transparency, and bias mitigation
